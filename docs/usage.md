# Usage

This library is meant to take an A2L file generated by EcoCoder for the Ecotrons EV2274A and return a list of `Characteristic` and `Measurement` objects representing the [characteristics](characteristic.md) and [measurements](measurement.md) it defines.

## Parsing Files

To parse a file into a list of objects, use the function `countach.parse.parseFile(fileName: str) -> list`.
